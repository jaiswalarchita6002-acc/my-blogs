      <p>Scribble Day was one of those days we had been waiting for since the start of our final year. The moment you walk in wearing a plain white shirt, you already know it won’t stay plain for long. By the end, it becomes a colorful mess of signatures, doodles, and words that carry stories only we seniors will understand.</P>

<p>What makes it special is the feeling that it’s ours and ours alone. No juniors, no interruptions, just us. The laughter that echoed through the corridors that day was different—it wasn’t the casual everyday fun, it was the kind of laughter that comes with the awareness that this chapter is ending soon. Everyone was armed with markers, chasing each other, writing nicknames, drawing random cartoons, and even leaving dramatic quotes like they were writing in someone’s yearbook.</p>

<p>Some scribbles were hilarious—silly inside jokes or exaggerated sketches that would make us laugh every time we looked at them. Others were surprisingly emotional, lines that reminded us how much we’d grown together, or promises to never forget each other even when life pulls us in different directions.</p>

<p>By the end of it, our shirts didn’t just look messy—they looked alive, full of chaos and love. Standing together, looking at each other’s scribbled shirts, it felt like a badge of honor, proof that we had survived this journey together.</p>

<p>Scribble Day wasn’t about perfect words or neat writing—it was about capturing moments in the rawest, most unfiltered way. And that’s what made it so unforgettable. Years later, when any of us unfold those shirts, the colors may fade, but the memories never will.</p>
