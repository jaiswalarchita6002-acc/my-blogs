    <article class="content-area">
      <p>As you‚Äôve already guessed from the title, we‚Äôre here to talk about change‚Äîmy change. A change I never thought would happen. But little did I know, there was another side of my personality just waiting for its spotlight.And trust me, when it finally showed up‚Ä¶ life wasn‚Äôt the same anymore.</p>
<p> A quick flashback to Archita 1.0. she was kinda scared of people. Yep, you read that right. And trust me, Archita 2.0 has the exact same reaction as you‚ÄîSHOCKED. I mean, seriously, how could someone be afraid of people? But I was. I felt shy, awkward, and underconfident.</p>
<p>I was that kid you‚Äôve all seen‚Äîthe one eating alone in the classroom while everyone else had their friend groups. She lived in her own little world, convinced she was too tough a fit for anyone else‚Äôs circle.</p>
<p>And being part of what you guys call ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù, I never really got the trends‚Äîthe emoji theories, the endless slangs, the inside jokes. Keeping up with all that? Yeah‚Ä¶ not exactly my thing.But what happens when you stop ‚Äúkeeping up‚Äù and just start being yourself? That‚Äôs where the magic begins.</p>
<p>Back in school, boys never even looked at me. And somewhere deep down, I thought maybe I wasn‚Äôt worth being friends with. But college? Oh, that was a whole different story. It wasn‚Äôt just a place to study‚Äîit was my chance to finally be me. Because guess what? In college, nobody really knows your past. So whatever side of your personality you choose to show, that becomes your entire personality there. And that‚Äôs exactly where Archita 2.0 was born</p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm confident. I don‚Äôt really care about people‚Äôs so-called opinions anymore. I‚Äôve learned to speak up for myself, to take a stand when I need to. And yeah, sometimes I‚Äôm a little messy or chaotic‚Äîbut honestly, that‚Äôs just me, and I‚Äôm okay with it. The difference is, I don‚Äôt beat myself up for it anymore.</p.

<p>I used to be so insecure, always doubting if I was good enough, always thinking too much about what others thought. But slowly, I started pushing back against those thoughts. Step by step, I found my voice. And now? I laugh louder, I talk without holding back, and I actually enjoy walking into a room full of people instead of wishing I could disappear. I start conversations, I make memories, I even turn awkward silences into inside jokes. I‚Äôm not hiding anymore‚ÄîI‚Äôm finally living.</p>
<p>But trust me, my cores are still the same. I‚Äôm still that girl who loves old Bollywood music, still obsessed with Disney cartoons (yep, I still watch them), and still vibing to every chatpata gaana out there.The difference? Now I don‚Äôt hide it‚ÄîI own it.</p>
<p>I still cry over cheesy romantic films, and I still fall in love with the rain every single time.Some things just don‚Äôt change‚Äîand honestly, I don‚Äôt want them to.And here‚Äôs the truth‚Äîit‚Äôs not like I had never been ‚Äúloud‚Äù before. I had my moments. But back then, I just wasn‚Äôt brave enough to own it.</p>
