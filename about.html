  <h2>About Archita Jaiswal</h2>
  <p>
   Archita Jaiswal was born in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, but her story was never tied down to one place. Being an army kid meant growing up across different cities, carrying pieces of each along the way. With a father in the army, her household was built on strict rules, discipline, and sharp routines—life inside those walls was anything but easy.</p>

<p>And yet, Archita turned out nothing like the system tried to shape her. She is rebellious at heart, bold enough to live life on her own terms, unapologetic about walking paths that don’t always look like the “right” ones. The army lifestyle gave her structure, but her spirit gave her freedom.</p>

<p>Her personality? Messy, random, unpredictable—beautifully imperfect. She thrives in being different, in standing out from the crowd rather than blending in. For Archita, being “out of place” has always been her place.</p>

<p>This blog is her canvas—a place where she shares everthing about her small messy world , WELCOME TO her  world , welcome to her BLOGS! </p>
